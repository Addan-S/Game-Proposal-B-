# Blackjack
A Simple Blackjack game. <hr>

## Rules
- The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
- Face cards (K,Q,J) are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
- Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
- To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
- If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
- If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.

## Technical Challenges
- One challenge I know that I have to overcome is creating the betting features.
- Another challenge I can already see is creating the actual deck.
- Integrating these features into the DOM is going to be tough.
- Creating the logic for the dealer is another difficulty.
